# Imperial College London Blockchain Group Shared Repository

#### Initiated: 28-02-2022

## Intro
A repo containing shared data, pipelines and findings for the Imperial College London Blockchain Group.  

## Structure
This repo uses the following structure:  

```
├── Data  
│   ├── Price    
│   └── Tweets    
├── Findings  
│   ├── Images  
│   └── Learning_Resources    
├── Notebooks  
└── Pipelines  
    └── my_data_pipelines  
```
  
The idea is to gather and clean data and save it in *Data/*,  
then explore and analyse the data in notebooks in *Notebooks/*,  
then write-up findings and or save plots in *Findings/*.   

A data pipeline is a broad term referring to the 
chain of processes involved in the movement of data
from one or more systems to the next. The idea behind
the *Pipelines/* directory is to house commonly used data
gathering/analysis scripts/code that can be re-used.
